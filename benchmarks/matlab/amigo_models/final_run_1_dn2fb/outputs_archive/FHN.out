------>IMPORTANT!!: Most of the optimization solvers have their own
                    tunning parameters (options).
                    Defaults have been assigned in the *NLPsolver*_options
                    files. You may need to modify those settings for your
                    particular problem, specially:
                      - maximum number of function evaluations /iterations,
